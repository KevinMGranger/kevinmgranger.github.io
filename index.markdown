I write code and design games.

I've always had an appreciation for technology. I've loved the idea of programming computers ever since I first laid my hands on a keyboard, and I've loved games and the idea of making them ever since I laid my hands on my first controller.

I'm a fifth-year student at RIT, majoring in Game Design &amp; Development, and minoring in Computer Science. I've got a strong background in physics, and Linux / Unix systems.

I care about leadership development, and campus community involvement.

I'm interested in software development (especially tooling), game development, and systems architecture.
